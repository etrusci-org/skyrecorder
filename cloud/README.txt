HELLO THERE!

These are raw skyrecorder (sky.etrusci.org) video recordings for VJs and similar artists who have an idea for making something new out of it.
I don't want you to just use the files to copy my timelapse project, but if you have an idea for something new, enjoy!
Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions or want to share the work you created out of these files - my contact address can always be found on my website.

Vibes,
arT2 <etrusci.org>
